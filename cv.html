<h1 class="unnumbered" id="major-system-research-projects">Major System
Research Projects</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>ML Systems and OurAI (2017 - now)</p>
<p>Led the research and prototyping of 2 internal ML systems: Delfin for
large scale ML training, and BLIS for ML inferencing. These systems were
used internally by researchers as well as business unit engineers. Using
these as foundations, we built automatic MLOps pipelines that simplify
the execution and deployment of ML projects, from data processing all
the way to model re-training. These systems also contribute to a later
OurAI project that virtualizes disaggregated ML resources into a single
virtual system that leverages blockchain for identity, accounting and
incentivization.</p></li>
<li><p>WYRE messaging (2015 - 2017)</p>
<p>Led investigation and prototyping of an innovative messaging
application where a message comes with an active execution environment.
This allows simple use cases such as a self-updating message to
extremely powerful use cases where entire application can be “sent” via
messages, allowing access to application without installation as well as
delegation of authority.</p></li>
<li><p>SoftRouter (1999 - 2001)</p>
<p>Served as one of the 2 principal researchers in the SoftRouter
project. This project is to investigate a novel network architecture
which proposes a radical separation of a router’s control and forwarding
functions. This decoupling allows for greater flexibility, scalability,
and reliability in network design by moving the complex, software-based
control plane to external off-the-shelf compute servers. The project
became an internal venture where I served as the CTO for the venture.
The outcome of the venture was later “spinned-in” as a commercial
networking product. In its first year, it had a revenue of over
$35M.</p></li>
<li><p>Viper – IP Edge Router (1998 – 1999) Led research and prototyping
of an IP Edge Router that allows programmable code to be loaded and
executed on IP data flows that traverse the router. The research
included a complete HW prototype of the entire concept.</p></li>
<li><p>WDS – Wireless Data Server (1995 – 1998) Led research and
prototyping of one of the first ever “bridge” between a mobile phone and
the general Internet. Created a simple client within a traditional
non-smart mobile phone and allowed it to retrieve information from the
general internet.</p></li>
